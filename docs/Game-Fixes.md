# Game compatibility fixes

These cases exercise the standalone content loader and the shared emulator core.
The local corpus is not distributed with the repository. Set `LAVAX_GAME_ROOT`
to its `lavax_game` directory, then run:

```powershell
cargo test -p lavaxemu --test game_compatibility -- --ignored
```

Only games with a completed display and input regression appear below. Startup
without an execution error alone does not establish playability.

## Dark Chess (暗子象棋)

- Content: `LAVA1 暗子象棋/未打包/暗子象棋.lav`.
- Problem: the game opens `/LavaData/SCC.dat`, but its unpacked companion
  `SCC.dat` sits beside the program. The missing-file screen exits on a key press.
- Fix: when an exact `/LavaData/...` file is missing, resolve an existing
  companion at the content root. Actual device directory files take priority.
  Reads and writes use the same file entry, preserving write-back to the
  original companion rather than making a divergent copy.
- Validation: title, player-name prompts, board, cursor movement, piece flipping,
  and continued execution; 1,800-frame scripted replay and an opt-in regression.
